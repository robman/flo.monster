# flo.monster Licensing

This project uses a dual-license model:

## packages/browser — Business Source License 1.1

The browser package (`packages/browser`) is licensed under the Business
Source License 1.1. This means you can view, modify, and use the code for
non-production purposes. Production use requires a commercial license from
the licensor until the Change Date (2030-02-16), after which the code
converts to AGPL-3.0.

See `packages/browser/LICENSE` for the full text.

## packages/core, packages/hub, packages/proxy — AGPL-3.0

All other packages are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License
v3.0. You are free to use, modify, and distribute these packages under the
